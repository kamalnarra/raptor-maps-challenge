# raptor-maps-challenge

Here is my code for the tech screen. I had a lot of fun implementing it and hope you enjoy my solution :blush:

The project description makes it clear that this challenge was designed to simulate a real world situation, so I implemented my solution accordingly. Instead of independtly calculating the distances, I used a Pandas dataframe to represent all of the data given to me alongside an adjancy matrix of every technician's proximity to one another.
